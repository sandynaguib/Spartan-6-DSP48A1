# Spartan-6-DSP48A1
The design of the code is divided into 4 stages as shown in the screenshot attached below, where I separated the generate statements to improve the readability of the code. The code is built using mainly generate if and two instantiated modules whether to load synchronously or asynchronously where the mux is implemented internally in the instantiated modules.
